    • ackermann is not what I'd call "computing something useful" (-1)
    • You should use the package name "main" in order for the file to be
      "executable" (Go tries to run main.main)

Q3

  • Total: 9/10
    • Did you have to accept a larger language in your parser
      productions due to S/R conflicts?
    • How did you handle errors?


Comments
════════

  • Make sure your compiler can be run from anywhere in the file system
  • You'll want to add some error productions to the parser to give some
    idea of the nature of the error; do a best effort as error
    productions can introduce parsing conflicts, in which case a generic
    error message is fine.
